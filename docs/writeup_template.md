# GPT-4 Health Advice Evaluation: Factual Accuracy and Bias Analysis

## Executive Summary

_[Fill in after running analysis notebook]_

- GPT-4 achieved an average score of X.X/5.0 across 13 health questions
- Key findings on factual accuracy vs. verified sources (CDC, WHO, Mayo Clinic)
- Identified X questions with concerning accuracy and Y with potential bias

## Research Question

**How factually accurate and unbiased are GPT-4's responses to common mental health and wellness questions compared to information from the CDC and WHO?**

## Methodology

- **Dataset**: 13 health questions spanning pregnancy, mental health, general wellness, and medical procedures
- **Ground Truth**: Verified information from CDC, WHO, Mayo Clinic, and medical communities
- **Evaluation**: GPT-4 as evaluator on 4 criteria (1-5 scale):
  - Factual Accuracy
  - Clarity
  - Neutrality (bias assessment)
  - Helpfulness
- **Analysis**: Statistical analysis and categorization by health topic

## Key Findings

### Overall Performance

_[Update with actual results from notebook]_

- Average Overall Score: X.X/5.0
- Strongest Criterion: [X]
- Weakest Criterion: [X]
- Best Performing Category: [X]
- Worst Performing Category: [X]

### Factual Accuracy Concerns

_[Fill in specific examples]_

- X questions scored ≤2/5 on factual accuracy
- Most concerning responses were in [category]
- Example: [specific dangerous/incorrect advice]

### Bias and Neutrality Issues

_[Fill in specific examples]_

- X questions showed potential bias (neutrality ≤3/5)
- Areas of concern: [cultural sensitivity, demographic assumptions, etc.]

### Category-Specific Insights

_[Update with results]_

- **Pregnancy/Reproductive Health**: Average score X.X/5
- **Mental Health**: Average score X.X/5
- **Medical Procedures**: Average score X.X/5
- **General Health**: Average score X.X/5

## Critical Safety Concerns

_[Highlight dangerous responses]_

1. **[Question about X]**: GPT-4 provided potentially harmful advice...
2. **[Medical advice]**: Contradicted established medical guidelines...

## Recommendations for AI Safety in Healthcare

1. **Implement stricter fact-checking** for medical responses
2. **Add disclaimers** encouraging users to consult healthcare professionals
3. **Improve training data** with more recent medical guidelines
4. **Bias mitigation** in responses about sensitive health topics
5. **Category-specific improvements** for [worst performing category]

## Implications for Public Health

_[Discuss broader impact]_

- Potential risks of AI-generated health advice
- Need for regulation and oversight
- Recommendations for healthcare AI development

## Limitations

- Small sample size (13 questions)
- Single LLM evaluation (GPT-4 evaluating GPT-4)
- Limited to English-language sources
- No real-world patient outcome data

## Future Research

- Expand to larger question dataset
- Use medical expert evaluation instead of AI evaluation
- Test multiple LLMs (Claude, Llama, etc.)
- Longitudinal study of AI health advice accuracy
- Patient safety outcome studies
