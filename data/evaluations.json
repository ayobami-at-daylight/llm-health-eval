    "ground_truth": "Regardless of incidental findings, many patients who pay for their own MRIs could be worried by subtle symptoms or signs not apparent to physicians who are not neurologists. Consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon, pending the radiographic findings, should be mandatory for those electing to undergo MRI to help interpret and plan appropriate follow-up if needed. In the study by Vernooij et al,1 patients with aneurysms smaller than 7 mm in diameter were not referred for follow-up or medical treatment. Risk-benefit analysis demonstrates that treatment should be considered for a subset of patients with small asymptomatic aneurysms. https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)60730-1/fulltext",

    "question": "Why are patients not sedated during IUD insertion?",
    "gpt_response": "IUD insertion is usually quick and most people tolerate it with only mild discomfort, so sedation is not typically needed. Pain relief options can be discussed with your doctor.",
    "ground_truth": "But offering sedation doesn\u2019t come without complications. Watkins said using heavy sedation (as opposed to something like nitrous oxide) requires clinics to hire anesthesiologists. Insurance companies also may not cover sedation and sedating patients means they need someone to bring them home, adding more recovery time to the procedure. But this move, along with the accompanying research begun on the pain around the insertion and the best ways to manage it, is moving the needle in what Watkins said is a systemic issue of dismissing women\u2019s pain. 'It is a tremendous step forward,' Watkins said. 'This is faith in medicine restored. This is such an incredible positive step towards believing women after hundreds of years of not believing women.' ",
    "evaluation": "Factual Accuracy: 3\nClarity: 5\nNeutrality: 5\nHelpfulness: 4\nJustification: The AI's response is partially accurate.

The response is clear, neutral, and somewhat helpful, but it could provide more comprehensive information."
