Its benefits should be considered as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. Also, consuming lemon water in excess or in concentrated form can potentially damage tooth enamel over time due to its acidity, so it's often recommended to drink it through a straw or rinse your mouth with plain water afterwards."

    "ground_truth": "Regardless of incidental findings, many patients who pay for their own MRIs could be worried by subtle symptoms or signs not apparent to physicians who are not neurologists. Consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon, pending the radiographic findings, should be mandatory for those electing to undergo MRI to help interpret and plan appropriate follow-up if needed. In the study by Vernooij et al,1 patients with aneurysms smaller than 7 mm in diameter were not referred for follow-up or medical treatment. Risk-benefit analysis demonstrates that treatment should be considered for a subset of patients with small asymptomatic aneurysms. https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)60730-1/fulltext",

This can lead to soil depletion, where the soil becomes less rich in nutrients necessary for plant growth, thus affecting the nutrient content of the crops grown in it.\n\n2. **Breeding Practices**: The breeding of crops for characteristics such as size, growth rate, and pest resistance sometimes occurs at the expense of nutritional quality. For example, selecting varieties that grow faster and bigger might lead to lower concentrations of minerals, vitamins, and other beneficial phytochemicals in the plants.\n\n3. **Environmental Changes**: Changes in climate and atmospheric conditions, including increased levels of carbon dioxide, can also alter plant growth and nutrient composition.

Breast milk is more than 80% water. If you think your baby is thirsty, you can offer an extra breastfeed. Many mothers find that their babies want to breastfeed more often on hot days.\n\nGiving water to a baby under six months can cause diarrhoea and lead to malnutrition.

Their bodies need the nutrients from breast milk or formula for growth and development. Drinking water can fill up their tiny stomachs, making them less hungry for feedings and potentially leading to weight loss and malnutrition. Also, giving water to a baby can cause an imbalance in their electrolyte levels, leading to serious health issues such as seizures.

Don't use such products while taking these antibiotics.\n\nModest alcohol use doesn't affect most antibiotics.

        "response": "The amount of water you should drink each day can vary based on factors such as your health, activity levels, and climate. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggests a daily water intake of about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) for men and about 2.7 liters (91 ounces) for women from all beverages and foods. However, around 80% of this typically comes from beverages, including water and other drinks, and the rest from food.\n\nIt's important to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty. Your needs may increase if you are very active, live in a hot climate, or are pregnant or breastfeeding. Always adjust your intake based on your activity level and environmental conditions."

It's important to combine healthy eating with regular physical activity and to make changes that can be sustained over the long term."
