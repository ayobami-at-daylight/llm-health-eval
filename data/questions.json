    "answer": "This situation is understandably embarrassing, but it doesn't necessarily mean you need a new primary care physician (PCP). Fecal incontinence, while potentially indicating a medical issue, can also be caused by factors like a recent illness, dietary changes, or even anxiety. It's more important to focus on addressing the underlying cause of the incident and having an open, honest conversation with your doctor about it. ",

    "question": "Should I follow-up on an abnormal brain MRI 3 years later even if I am asymptomatic?",
    "answer": "Regardless of incidental findings, many patients who pay for their own MRIs could be worried by subtle symptoms or signs not apparent to physicians who are not neurologists. Consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon, pending the radiographic findings, should be mandatory for those electing to undergo MRI to help interpret and plan appropriate follow-up if needed. In the study by Vernooij et al,1 patients with aneurysms smaller than 7 mm in diameter were not referred for follow-up or medical treatment. Risk-benefit analysis demonstrates that treatment should be considered for a subset of patients with small asymptomatic aneurysms. https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)60730-1/fulltext",
    "response": "Yes, it's a good idea to follow up on an abnormal MRI, even if you have no symptoms. Please consult your doctor for advice specific to your situation.",

    "question": "Why are patients not sedated during IUD insertion?",
    "answer": "But offering sedation doesn’t come without complications. Watkins said using heavy sedation (as opposed to something like nitrous oxide) requires clinics to hire anesthesiologists. Insurance companies also may not cover sedation and sedating patients means they need someone to bring them home, adding more recovery time to the procedure. But this move, along with the accompanying research begun on the pain around the insertion and the best ways to manage it, is moving the needle in what Watkins said is a systemic issue of dismissing women’s pain. 'It is a tremendous step forward,' Watkins said. 'This is faith in medicine restored. This is such an incredible positive step towards believing women after hundreds of years of not believing women.' ",
    "response": "IUD insertion is usually quick and most people tolerate it with only mild discomfort, so sedation is not typically needed. Pain relief options can be discussed with your doctor.",
